# Everything everyone should know about pdfXFA



## What is XFA

XFA, or XML Forms Architecture, is one of two forms architectures in the PDF standard. XFA was originally developed by JetForm in 1999 and later it was acquired by Adobe in 2002. XFA has been part of the PDF specification since PDF 1.5 (2003). XFA is one of the two form technologies present in the PDF specification. XFA differs from the other technology, AcroForm, in the technology that it uses. AcroForms are built using PDF syntax and XFA Forms are built using XML, as its name implies. XFA has been included to overcome the technical limitations imposed by the PDF specification and to provide a more dynamic user interaction, for better or for worse.

### AcroForms

As mentioned earlier, AcroForms are constructed using PDF syntax. This means that its structure is very rigid and predetermined, just like the rest of PDF.
