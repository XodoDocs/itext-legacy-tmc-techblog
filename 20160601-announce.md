As you have probably noticed by now, iText Software has released a new major version of its flagship library iText. This blog post will focus a bit more on the reasons why we chose to write iText 7, and on the roadmap.

Reasons
---

While we were always pretty happy with the capabilities of iText as they stood, there were a number of design choices that limited our wiggling room for further development. Over the years, a number of changes were introduced that used and transformed the existing framework in unintended, or even borderline improper ways. This was not per se a bad thing for the existing functionality, but it made further extensibility - and, importantly, future-proofing - much more difficult. Furthermore, some APIs were entirely public, which hampered our potential to reimplement functionality.

As a result of all this, it was decided to rewrite iText from scratch almost three years ago[1]. Building from the ground up allowed us to make performance improvements which were impossible with the existing code, to make iText much more extensible and configurable from client code, and to get rid of some of the accumulated cruft that a project inevitably accumulates. The main improvements from a user's viewpoint are:

* the Renderer framework, which lets you plug custom layout code into the standard library, thus reducing the need for the kind of feature requests that led to iText 5's mild case of featuritis.
* the modularity of iText 7. You may need only a few of the modules for your use case, which will reduce the total size of your application. Add-ons are available for specific functionality, but they don't encumber users that don't need them.
* uniformity in the PDF writer engine. In iText 5, there were several rendering APIs it was impossible to achieve some behavior (like right-to-left text) on one of them.

Things that stay the same (or similar)

While designing the code, we of course depended on our experience with our older versions. Since it already does a lot of things well, we took over some of the behavior of iText 5.

* The licensing model is unchanged: iText 7 is still released as free software[4] under the AGPL software license, with commercial options available to users that do not wish to adhere to it. By making iText 7 more extensible and configurable, we hope to encourage users in the spirit of the AGPL to create third-party libraries that provide common functionality which isn't in the standard library[5].

* PDF parsing and text extraction, designed and written for iText 5 by Kevin Day[6], was ported with only some object name changes.

* The signing module is functionally equivalent to, and virtually unchanged from the iText 5 implementation.

* The PDF/A functionality is as easy to use as in iText 5.

* The layout module, with its HTML-like objects like Paragraph, List, etc, corresponds very closely to the high-level API of iText 5. Some classes have been renamed, but everything is very similar and transition should be easy for basic use cases. For more advanced use cases, you'll need to look into the Renderer framework.


Roadmap
---

We did an early release of iText 7.0.0 for Java[2] on May 1st to support our presence at the Great Indian Developer Summit and to underscore our dedication to supporting any script system in PDF. Currently we are working on the port of the new code base towards .NET, which should be released by June 15th[3]. From then on, we'll focus on writing documentation and tutorials to accomodate users and to document our own, in-house experiences with the new code base.

iText 7 for Java[2] targets Java 7, which we felt was the lowest version we could reasonably support. While Java 8 is already well-adopted, we need to support as much of the - even though Java 7 is already technically EOL. The .NET version of iText 7 will initially target the .NET Framework 4.0, and we are also looking into supporting .NET Core and UWP in the near future.
