As you have probably noticed by now, iText Software has recently released iText 7,
a new major version of its flagship library which is not backwards compatible to iText 5.
This technical blog post will focus a bit more on the reasons why we chose to rewrite iText 7 from scratch,
and I'll also detail our roadmap for the near future.

Reasons
---

While we were always pretty happy with the capabilities of iText as they stood,
there were a number of design choices that limited our wiggling room for further development.
Over the years, a number of changes were introduced that used and transformed the existing framework in unintended,
or even borderline improper ways. This was not per se a bad thing for the existing functionality,
but it made further extensibility - and, importantly, future-proofing for PDF 2.0 - much more difficult.
Furthermore, some APIs were entirely public, which hampered our potential to reimplement functionality.

As a result of all this, it was decided to rewrite iText from scratch in December 2013, thus breaking backward compatibility.
Building from the ground up allowed us to make performance improvements which were impossible with the existing code,
to make iText much more extensible and configurable from client code,
and to get rid of some of the cruft that a project inevitably accumulates.
The main improvements from a user's viewpoint are:

* iText 7 is modular, whereas the core library for iText 5 was one big JAR/DLL.
You may need only a few of the modules for your use case, so you can reduce the total size of your compiled application.
Add-ons are available for specific functionality, but they don't encumber users that don't need them.
* uniformity in the PDF rendering engine. In iText 5, there are several rendering APIs,
which have a lot of functional overlap but also show (sometimes subtle) differences in behavior.
* the Renderer framework, which lets you plug custom layout code into the standard library,
thus reducing the need for the kind of feature requests that led to iText 5's mild case of featuritis.

Things that stay the same
---

While designing the code, we of course depended on our experience with our older versions.
Since iText 5 already does a lot of things well, we took over some of its behavior and characteristics.

* The licensing model is unchanged: iText 7 is still released as FOSS software under the AGPL software license,
with commercial options available to users that do not wish to adhere to it.

* PDF parsing and text extraction was ported with only a few object name changes.

* The signing module is functionally equivalent to, and virtually unchanged from the iText 5 implementation.

* The PDF/A functionality is as easy to use as in iText 5.

* The layout module, with its HTML-like objects like Paragraph, List, etc,
corresponds very closely to the high-level API of iText 5.
Some classes have been renamed, but everything is very similar
and transition should be easy for basic use cases.
For more advanced use cases, you'll need to look into the Renderer framework.

Next steps
---

We did an early release of iText 7 for Java on May 1st to support our presence at the
Great Indian Developer Summit and to underscore our dedication to supporting any script system in PDF.
Currently we are working on the port of the new code base so that we can release iText 7 for .NET as soon as possible.
From then on, we'll focus on finishing our ongoing efforts to write documentation and tutorials to accomodate users,
and to document our own, in-house experiences with the new code base.

We'll also write a successor to iText 5's successful XMLWorker add-on,
to support users that prefer to design their PDF reports with HTML and/or custom XML syntax.

Platform versions
---

iText 7 is built upon the Java SE 7 platform. Earlier versions have been EOL for multiple years
and are not commonly used for new projects. Even though Java 7 itself is also (more recently) EOL,
it is still very commonly used in the Java community. Another reason why we couldn't really go lower,
is that we use the enum `java.lang.Character.UnicodeScript`, which is only available from Java 7 onwards.

Similarly, the .NET version of iText 7 will target the .NET Framework 4.0 as a reasonable base line for the future.
We are also planning to support .NET Core and UWP in the near future alongside the .NET Framework.
