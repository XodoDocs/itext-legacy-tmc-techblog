# about us

iText is a software developer toolkit that allows users to integrate PDF functionalities within their applications, processes or products. You know that PDF is one of the world's most widely used document formats, but perhaps you didn't know how it can keep being revolutionary? iText, in turn, is one of the best-documented and versatile PDF engines in the world. By harnessing the power of pdf with the iText libraries and addons, you can really move towards a smart document workflow.

**Figure 1**: A somewhat complete overview of the many ways iText can enrich your document workflow

iText can be used in many places of your document workflow.
From data aquisition (pdf2Data, pdfXFA, iText Core Library), to data transformations (pdfHtml), document generation (pdfHtml, Tyrion, pdfInvoice, iText Core Library) to redaction (pdfSweep).
Our software suite allows you to effortlessly handle digital documents in a way that can be tailored to your workflow.

## information aquisition

For information aquisition, iText can help process incoming pdf document. If your data is structured enough, you could benifit from using pdf2Data wich allows you to use templating to extract data in xml form. If your data is unstructured, you could use the iText Core Library to extract raw text, images, links, etc. If you have a pdf document that contains forms, pdfXFA can help you obtain the information your end-users filled in.

## pdf generation

Most business processes end with the generation of a report of some kind. Airline companies might automatically generate boarding passes, other companies have used iText to generate invoices, or even quality assurance reports. Regardless of the usecase, iText can help you generate digital documents that benefit from the richness of pdf.

### program your document

One of the options for generating your document is to program it. Doing so, you would add all the code needed to generate your document from scratch.
Once this code is written, tested, and debugged, you can treat is as a black box. Information comes in (e.g. records from a database) and pdfs come out (e.g. boarding passes).
This approach offers you full control of the document that is generated.

### html conversion

If you feel more comfortable generating HTML, or if your existing processes generate HTML, the pdfHTML iText add-on can help you turn those HTML documents into PDF documents.
pdfHTML supports HTML 5 and CSS 3. 

### templating

The last (common) usecase we mention here is templating. Some of our customers prefer building a stunning pdf document with programs like InDesign, adding images, text and other content elements intuitively.
By adding formfields, you can then use iText to fill in your template and generate a custom PDF every time.
One of our customers uses this exact approach to generate seating tickets.
