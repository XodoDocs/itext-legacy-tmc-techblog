Many of you are aware that iText Software provides [dedicated technical support](http://itextpdf.com/support) to its paying customers. However, we also have a very large user base which complies with the AGPL license. Since they don't pay for support, they have to rely on their own debugging skills and, as a fallback channel, on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/itext) to solve their iText problems.

Those of you who have stared into the abyss of iText 5's [`ColumnText::go`](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/blob/develop/itext/src/main/java/com/itextpdf/text/pdf/ColumnText.java#L997) method, and survived, know that debugging our good old rendering engine can be a daunting task because of that method's recursive nature. `ColumnText::go` was the organic result of almost 20 years of refactoring of the original iText code, and it's one of the prime examples why we chose to reimplement our library. Below is a short overview of the architecture of the *Renderer Framework* in iText 7.

There are three main concepts used by the framework:

* `Element`s, are the high-level layout objects that will be rendered
* `RootElement`s are the background upon which layout objects are drawn. They function as element containers.
* `Renderer`s draw the layout objects onto the layout containers

On a technical level, the Renderer Framework consists of a class hierarchy, the branches of which interact with each other. At the top is the `IPropertyContainer` interface, which has an API reminiscent of the `java.util.Map` or `System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary` interfaces. Inheriting from it are an abstract class `ElementPropertyContainer`, and two interfaces `IELement` and `IRenderer`.

* `ElementPropertyContainer` defines a set of default behaviors for all `Element` and `RootElement` objects
* `IElement` provides accessor methods for an `IRenderer`. It will be implemented by all `Element`s
* `IRenderer` provides:
** accessor methods for an `IPropertyContainer`; it is understood that this should be an `IElement` or `RootElement`
** a method definition for calculating the space requirements for its associated `IElement`
** a method definition for drawing it on the `RootElement`
