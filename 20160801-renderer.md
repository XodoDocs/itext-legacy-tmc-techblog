Many of you are aware that iText Software provides [dedicated support](http://itextpdf.com/support) to its paying customers. However, we also have a very large user base that complies with the AGPL license. Since they don't pay for technical support, they have to rely on their own debugging skills and, as a fallback channel, on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/itext) to solve their iText problems.

Those who have stared into the abyss of iText 5's [`ColumnText::go`](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/blob/develop/itext/src/main/java/com/itextpdf/text/pdf/ColumnText.java#L997) method, and survived, know that debugging our good old rendering engine could be a daunting task because of that method's recursive nature and opaque method overrides. `ColumnText::go` was the organic result of almost 20 years of refactoring of the original iText code, and it's one of the prime examples why we chose to reimplement our library.

The main innovation of the new implementation in iText 7 is the Renderer Framework. Its architecture is explained in detail in the introduction to the [technical tutorial](http://developers.itextpdf.com/content/itext-7-building-blocks/we-start-overview-classes-and-interfaces) for iText 7. The framework defines three main concepts:

* an `Element` is a high-level layout object that will be written to a PDF document
* a `RootElement` is the background upon which layout objects are drawn. It functions as an element container
* a `Renderer` draws an `Element` onto a `RootElement`
	* `RootElement` objects also have a special `RootRenderer`, which will perform calculations for layout positionings
	
The flexibility in the framework lies in the configurability and pluggability of the Renderer objects. All Renderer types implement the methods defined in the `IRenderer` interface:

* layout(): will calculate how much of the object will fit onto the RootElement
* getOccupiedArea(): gets the area that the Element will try to occupy
* draw(): will write the graphical instructions to the RootElement
* isFlushed(): determines whether draw() has already been called
* addChild(), setParent(), getChildRenderers(), getNextRenderer(): methods for constructing and querying the hierarchy of the Renderer tree

Every `Element` has its own renderer implementation, and uses it by default. It is exceedingly easy to customize the rendering rules for a specific layout object, by plugging in a homebrewn `Renderer` class, or a subclass of the `Element`'s default renderer with a few modifications.

```cs
Div element = new Div();
element.SetNextRenderer(new MyDivRenderer(element));
document.add(element);
```

It is also possible to let all objects of a certain type use your custom `Renderer`, by subclassing the `Element` and creating these objects instead of the default type.

```java
class MyDiv extends Div {
    @Override
    protected IRenderer makeNewRenderer() {
        return new MyDivRenderer(this);
    }
}
```

As already hinted at in the introduction to this post, another great advantage lies in debugging your application. Instead of a turtles-all-the-way-down stack of go() calls, as in iText 5, you clearly see where, and how deep, in the hierarchy you are:
