Many of you are aware that iText Software provides [dedicated technical support](http://itextpdf.com/support) to its paying customers. However, we also have a very large user base which complies with the AGPL license. Since they don't pay for support, they have to rely on their own debugging skills and, as a fallback channel, on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/itext) to solve their issues.

Those of you who have stared into the abyss of iText 5's [`ColumnText::go`](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/blob/develop/itext/src/main/java/com/itextpdf/text/pdf/ColumnText.java#L997) method, and survived, know that debugging our good old rendering engine can be a daunting task because of that method's recursive nature. `ColumnText::go` was the organic result of almost 20 years of refactoring of the original iText code, and it's one of the prime examples why we chose to reimplement our library. Below is a short overview of the architecture of the *Renderer Framework* in iText 7.

The Renderer Framework consists of a hierarchy, the branches of which interact with each other. At the top is the `IPropertyContainer` interface, which has an API reminiscent of the `java.util.Map` or `System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary` interfaces. Inheriting from it are an abstract class `ElementPropertyContainer`, and two interfaces `IELement` and `IRenderer`.
